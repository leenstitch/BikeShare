# BikeShare Project

## Project Description
This project uses Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The goal is to analyze patterns in bike share usage, including trips, users, and time statistics.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer.
2. Download the project files from GitHub.
3. Open a terminal in the project directory.
4. Run the main script:
 python bikeshare.py
5. Follow the prompts to explore bike share data.

## Files
- `bikeshare.py`: Main Python script to analyze the bike share data.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `GitCommandsDocumentation.md`: Documentation of the Git commands used.
- `.gitignore`: Ensures CSV files are not uploaded to GitHub.

## Notes / Assumptions
- CSV data files for each city should be downloaded locally (they are **not** pushed to GitHub).
- Users are prompted in the terminal to filter data by city, month, or day.
- The project demonstrates the use of Python, Pandas, and Git for version control.
